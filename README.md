#iOS UIActionSheet plugin for Trigger

A (native Trigger.io plugin)[https://trigger.io/docs/current/api/native_plugins/index.html "native Trigger.io plugins"] that lets you use Apple's native UIActionSheet API in your Trigger/Forge web applications.

##Usage with Javascript

`onDestroy()` and `onCancel()` set up two functions, one each for the two buttons on the UIActionSheet (destructive button, cancel buttonâ€¦ Support for more than two buttons is coming. Feel free to fork and pull request if you build it before I do.)
`forge.internal.call('actionsheet.show', { text: text, destructiveTitle: destructiveTitle, cancelTitle: cancelTitle }` displays a UIActionSheet with the values provided for text, destructive button title (`destructiveTitle`) and cancel button title (`cancelTitle`).
`forge.internal.addEventListener('actionsheet.destructive', onDestroy);` binds the onDestroy() function we set up earlier to the event thrown when the user taps the destructive button to dismiss the UIActionSheet. Replace `actionsheet.destructive` with `actionsheet.cancel` for the cancel event. Feel free to rename the onDestroy and onCancel functions.
  
  ```var onDestroy = function() {
    // Run this code upon tapping the destructive button
  };
  var onCancel = function() {
    // Run this code upon tapping the cancel button
  };
  
  forge.internal.call('actionsheet.show', {
    text: text,
    destructiveTitle: destructiveTitle,
    cancelTitle: cancelTitle
  }, function() {
    forge.internal.addEventListener('actionsheet.destructive', onDestroy);
    forge.internal.addEventListener('actionsheet.cancel', onCancel);
  });```
